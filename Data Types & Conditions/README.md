# Data Types and Conditions in Competitive Programming

## Data Types

In competitive programming, it is essential to know the different data types and their limits. The following are the most commonly used data types:

-   **Integer**: It is a whole number (positive, negative, or zero) without any decimal point. In C++, the range of an integer is from -2<sup>31</sup> to 2<sup>31</sup>-1. In Python, the range is not defined, and the integer can be of any length.
-   **Long long**: It is an extended data type in C++ used when the range of an integer exceeds the limit of int. In C++, the range of a long long is from -2<sup>63</sup> to 2<sup>63</sup>-1.
-   **Char**: It is a data type that stores a single character. In C++, it is represented by single quotes. For example, 'a', 'b', 'c'.
-   **String**: It is a data type that stores a sequence of characters. In C++, it is represented by double quotes. For example, "Hello".
-   **Boolean**: It is a data type that can have only two values: true or false.

## Conditions

Conditions are used to make decisions in a program. In competitive programming, some of the commonly used conditions are:

-   **If-else**: It is used to execute a block of code if a condition is true and another if it is false.
-   **Switch**: It is used to execute different blocks of code based on different conditions.
-   **Ternary operator**: It is a shorthand version of the if-else statement. It is used to assign a value based on a condition.

Understanding data types and conditions is essential in competitive programming as it helps in writing optimized and efficient code.



**And we are here to learn them in practice and get benefit of using them.**
