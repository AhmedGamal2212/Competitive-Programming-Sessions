# Graph Theory: Introduction

As mentioned previously, there is much to learn about graph theory. In this section, we will explore the fundamental concepts of graph theory and take our first steps in this interesting topic. This introduction is divided into two parts, or sessions.

**The first session** covers the basic terminology of graph theory, theoretical definitions, basic graph representations, and the idea and implementation of the two fundamental graph traversal algorithms: Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS).

**The second session** covers the implementation of standard introductory graph theory problems and tasks, including but not limited to: topological sorting, counting and finding connected components, finding the shortest path from single or multiple sources to all other nodes in the graph, queries to determine if nodes are connected, validating trees, finding and restoring cycles, and checking the bipartiteness of the graph.
